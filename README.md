# CitiBike
Citi Bike is a public bike-sharing system which allows users to ride rented bicycles from one bike station to another in New York City. It gains an increasing number of annual users in a short time due to the convenience it provides. Predicting the bike usage and demand is important for administrators to manage Citi Bike by reallocating and rebalancing.
